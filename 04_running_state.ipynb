    "In the previous notebook, we introduced some key LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) material regarding runnables. By now, you should be comfortable with both internal and external reasoning, as well as how to develop pipelines that facilitate it! In this notebook, we will make our way towards more advanced paradigms that will allow us to orchestrate more complex dialog management strategies and begin to execute on longer-form document reasoning.\n",

    "- Learning how to leverage runnables to orchestrate interesting LLM systems.  \n",
    "- Understanding how running state chains can be used for dialog management and iterative decision-making.\n",

    "- You may notice that the JSON prediction is actually working pretty well. It might not always work so well depending on the questions and the JSON format complexity. What kinds of issues do you expect to encounter in this regard?\n",
    "- What kinds of approaches can you think of completely swapping prompts as part of the running state chain?\n",

    "To build a responsive and intelligent system, we need a method that not only processes inputs but also retains and updates essential information through the flow of conversation. This is where the combination of LangChain and Pydantic becomes pivotal. [**Pydantic**](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/), a popular Python validation library, is instrumental in structuring and validating data models. As one of its features, Pydantic offers structured \"model\" classes that validate objects (data, classes, themselves, etc.) with simplified syntax and deep rabbitholes of customization options. This framework is used throughout LangChain and comes up as a necessary component for use cases that involve data coersion.\n",

    "One thing that a \"model\" is very good for is defining a class with expected arguments and some special ways to validate them! In this course, we won't focus too much on the validation scripts, but those interested can start by checking out the [**Pydantic Validator guide**](https://docs.pydantic.dev/1.10/usage/validators/) (though the topics do get pretty deep pretty fast). For our purposes, we can construct a `BaseModel` class and define some `Field` variables to create a structured **Knowledge Base** like so:"

    "**Design a chatbot that implements the following features:**\n",
    "- The bot should start off by making small-talk, possibly helping the user with non-sensitive queries which don't require any private info access.\n",
    "- When the user starts to ask about things that are database-walled (both practically and legally), tell the user that they need to provide the relevant information.\n",
    "- When the retrieval is successful, the agent will be able to talk about the database-walled information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This can be done with a variety of techniques, including the following:**\n",
    "- **Prompt Engineering and Context Parsing**, where the overall chat prompt stays roughly the same but the context is manipulated to to change agent behavior. For example, a failed db retrieval could be changed into an injection of natural-language instructions for how to resolve the problem such as *`\"Information could not be retrieved with keys {...}. Please ask the user for clarification or help them with known information.\"`*\n",
    "- **\"Prompt Passing,\"** where the active prompts are passed around as state variables and can be overridden by monitoring chains.\n",
    "- **Branching chains** such as [**`RunnableBranch`**](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/how_to/routing) or more custom solutions that implement an conditional routing mechanism.\n",
    "    - In the case of [`RunnableBranch`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/how_to/routing), a `switch` syntax of the style:\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableBranch\n",
    "        RunnableBranch(\n",
    "            ((lambda x: 1 in x), RPrint(\"Has 1 (didn't check 2): \")),\n",
    "            ((lambda x: 2 in x), RPrint(\"Has 2 (not 1 though): \")),\n",
    "            RPrint(\"Has neither 1 not 2: \")\n",
    "        ).invoke([2, 1, 3]);  ## -> Has 1 (didn't check 2): [2, 1, 3]\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Some prompts and a gradio loop are provided that might help with the effort, but the agent will currently just hallucinate! Please implement the internal chain to try and retrieve the relevant information. Before trying to implement, look over the default behavior of the model and note how it might hallucinate or forget things."
